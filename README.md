# Cogeo

A very simple chat app like Slack or Discord.  
The design is 100% homemade and most of the components are custom (input, textarea, dropdown...) to have a full control over the behavior and the design.

## Getting Started

Use `grunt serve` to start the app.

Use `grunt release` to create the minified version of the app.

Use `npm start` when the release is ready to start a live preview with **electron**.

Use `npm package-*` to create the electron packaged version of the app.  
This is the complete list of `package-*` commands :

- `package-all` to create all the avaialble packages
- `package-win` to create the windows package
- `package-lin` to create the linux package

## Running the tests

There is no test for now.  
We don't have the time for that, sorry.

## Built With

* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) - The Web's scaffolding tool for modern webapps
* [cozen](https://bitbucket.org/C0ZEN/cozen) - External custom library

## Contributing

Too early to add constraints over the way we want the app.

## Versioning

Too early to handle versioning.  
Nevertheless, the `master` branch is ready to receive some stuff.
