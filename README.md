# Cogeo

A very simple chat app like Slack or Discord.  
You can manage groups, channels and users.  

The design is 100% homemade.  
Most of the components are custom (input, textarea, dropdown...).  
We have a full control of the behavior and the design, via the [cozen](https://bitbucket.org/C0ZEN/cozen) library.

## Getting Started

Use `grunt serve` to start the app.

Use `grunt release` to create the minified version of the app.

Use `npm start` when the release is ready to start a live preview with **electron**.

Use `npm package-*` to create the electron packaged version of the app.  
This is the complete list of `package-*` commands :

- `package-all` to create all the avaialble packages
- `package-win` to create the windows package
- `package-lin` to create the linux package

## Running the tests

There is no test for now.  
We don't have the time for that, sorry.
