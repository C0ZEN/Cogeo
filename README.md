# Cogeo

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE)

A very simple but complete chat app like Slack and Discord.  
You can manage groups, channels and users.  

The design is 100% homemade.  
Most of the components are custom (input, textarea, dropdown...).  
We have a full control of the behavior and the design, via the [cozen](https://bitbucket.org/C0ZEN/cozen) library.

## About Cogeo

Do you want to know more about the Cogeo app ?  
Then this section if for you.

**Languages and Frameworks :**

- Front-End: AngularJS, HTML5, LESS, Electron, Grunt, Yeoman
- Back-End : NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Heroku

**Cozen library :**

We created the [cozen](https://bitbucket.org/C0ZEN/cozen) library at first to (re)create a lot of web components.  
This library handle translations, themes and app configuration.  
Plus, it give us a lot of generic services, filters and methods to increase the modularity for our apps.  

**Available translations :**

- English [en]
- Fran√ßais [fr]

**Available themes :**

- Atom

**Config :**

The config is extremly linked to the cozen library so we won't talk about all the possibilites in this repository.  
Basically, it's a bunch of providers to customize the app (we overrided it to add a specific internal config for Cogeo).

You just have to know that there are multiples usefull options to :

- Show/hide custom enhanced logs (super sexy logs in the console, multiple types to filter them)
- Show/hide a form generator (create random fake data and submit in less than 10ms ! Lazy as fuck we were)

**Cogeo progression :**

We almost achieve the first release version (~95% of our specifications).  
We have a complete Back-Office for the user, the groups and the channels (management is complete).  
We are working on the chat last features (async messages and video chat still missing).  
We started the creation of Robots (IA).

**API progression :**

The API is over.  
We are currently looking for creating a full and complete documentation.

## Getting Started

Before anything below, run `npm install` to install the **node_modules** and **bower_components**.

Use `grunt serve` to start the app.

Use `grunt release` to create the minified version of the app.

Use `npm start` when the release is ready to start a live preview with **electron**.

Use `npm run package-*` to create the electron packaged version of the app.  
This is the complete list of `package-*` commands :

- `package-all` to create all the avaialble packages
- `package-win` to create the windows package
- `package-lin` to create the linux package

## Running the tests

There is no test for now.  
We don't have the time for that, sorry.
