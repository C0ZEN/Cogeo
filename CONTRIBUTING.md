### Structure

The structure is only composed of three-levels of headers (h1, h2, h3).  
The only required element is a h1 on the top of the file.

You can use **bold**, *italic* or ~~scratch~~.  
You can use images, list, quote and code as well.  

Always think about segmented blocks (maximum three lines) to increase readability.  
Make use of h3 to split the blocks or just a blank line.

Example:

```
# This is the main title of a page - same as summary title

## This is a subtitle for an important section - this is not required

This is a block text.  
With a second line.

### I could add a subtitle too if necessary

This is a block text.  
With a second line.

### Bold & co

This **word** is bold.
This *word* is italic.
This ~~word~~ is scratch.

### A quote

> Quote me if you can !
```
