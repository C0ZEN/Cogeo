### Structure

The structure is only composed of three-levels of headers (h1, h2, h3).  
The only required element is a h1 on the top of the file.

You can use **bold**, *italic* or ~~scratch~~.  
You can use images, list, quote and code as well.  

Always think about segmented blocks (maximum three lines) to increase readability.  
Make use of h3 to split the blocks or just a blank line.

### Summary

Composed only of the top-level titles (#h1).  
Is a bullet list.

Example:

```
- My first header 1
- My second header 1
```
